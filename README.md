The wiki of this repository was initially a clone of the official Kratos wiki at https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/wiki.
The changes in the official Kratos wiki are continuously merged into this wiki. On top of that i add some material which can't be placed in the official Kratos wiki e.g. because they are not proofed or because they might be too much.
